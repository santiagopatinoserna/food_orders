# Online Food Orders Data Exploration

This Jupyter notebook is an exploration of the "food-online-orders" dataset from Kaggle. It performs a visual analysis of online food ordering data, focusing on distributions by gender, age group, monthly income, and the ordering frequency in relation to individuals' occupation.

## Key insights 
1. **Marital Status Matters**: Our analysis shows a whopping 76.1% of online food orders are made by singles! Couples, it's time to step up your online ordering game! 🤵‍♂️💻👰‍♀️
2. **Gender Parity in Palate**: The battle of the sexes is a tie when it comes to food delivery — each gender accounts for roughly 50% of orders. Everyone enjoys the convenience equally! 👨‍🍳👩‍🍳
3. **Age of Appetite**: A significant 50%+ of online food orders come from the vibrant 19-30 age bracket — the appetite for digital dining is strong with the young! 🍔📲
4. **Earnings & Eatings**: Interestingly, those with "No Income" lead with the highest number of food orders, possibly spotlighting a student demographic or supported individuals prioritizing convenience. 💼➡️🍕
5. **Family Size Feasts**: Bigger families might mean more home cooking? Our findings reveal a decline in orders as family size increases. Families of 3, however, are the exception, frequently saying yes to online orders. 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦📉
